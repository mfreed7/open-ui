<p class="todo">
  Add IDL to frontmatter (<a href="https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/356">#356</a>)
</p>

A `popup` element represents transient application UI that “pops up” in the
[top layer](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer) of a web document, enabling the user to
perform some task in a timely and immediate fashion. `popup` is similar to the `dialog` element, but
is distinguished by its transient nature (“light dismiss” behaviors) and mutual exclusivity: only
one `popup` element may be rendered at a time, with the exception of nested `popup`s.

<p class="note">
  Examples of popups include: button menus, listboxes used for item selection e.g. comboboxes,
  "teaching" UI, and other progressive-disclosure widgets or content pickers.
</p>

The `open` IDL attribute, on getting, must return the last value to which it was set. On setting,
it must be set to the new value. When the element is created, it must be set to `false`.

## Showing a `popup` element

A `popup` element and its contents must not be rendered unless:

- The `initiallyopen` attribute is specified
- The `show()` method is invoked
- Or the `popup` element has been invoked through user interaction with an element whose `popup`
  attribute references the `popup` element's ID

This requirement may be implemented indirectly through the style layer. For example,
user agents that
[support the suggested default rendering](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#renderingUA)
implement this requirement using the CSS rules described in the
[Rendering section](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#rendering).

<h3 id="popup-stack">The popup stack</h3>

This specification introduces a new stacking layer in the document
[top layer](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/zindex.html), called the **popup stack**. Each document has
one popup stack.

The popup stack is an [ordered set](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ordered-set) of elements,
rendered in the order they appear in the set. The last element in the set is rendered last,
and thus appears on top.

Showing or hiding a `popup` element adds or removes the element from the popup stack, respectively.

### The `initiallyopen` attribute

The `initiallyopen` attribute is a
[boolean attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attribute).
When specified, it indicates that the popup element will be shown upon document load, such that the
user can interact with it.

**Example:**

```html
<popup initiallyopen></popup>
```

When a `popup` element becomes
[browsing-context connected](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#becomes-browsing-context-connected), the
user agent must run the following steps, given a popup element _candidate subject_:

1. If the `initiallyopen` content attribute is specified on the _candidate subject_, run the
   [showing a `popup` element steps](#showing-popup-steps).
2. Otherwise, set the _candidate subject_'s _open state_ to `false`.

<p class="note">
  As a result of following this run step: in the event that initiallyopen is specified on multiple
  popups, the last of these popups (with the initiallyopen attribute) in the DOM order will be the
  popup that is rendered upon document load.
</p>

### The `show()` method

The `show()` method renders the `popup` element, such that the user can interact with it.

**Example:**

```html
<popup id="newFeatureUI">
  <p>
    <strong>New!</strong>
    I’m some sort of educational UI…
  </p>
</popup>

<script>
  if (upsellNewFeature) {
    document.getElementById('newFeatureUI').show()
  }
</script>
```

The show() method steps are to run the [showing a `popup` element steps](#showing-popup-steps) with
[this](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#this).

### The `popup` attribute

The `popup` attribute indicates that a related `popup` element will be shown or hidden as the
user interacts with the element where the `popup` attribute is specified. If the attribute is
specified, the attribute's value must be the ID of a `popup` element in the same
[node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document).

**Example:** Invoking the `button` element in this example will show/hide the `popup` element,
depending on whether or not the `popup` element is currently shown:

```html
<button id="menuButton" popup="menuPopup">Menu</button>
<popup id="menuPopup" role="menu" anchor="menuButton">
  <!-- Markup for menuitems goes here -->
</popup>
```

The `popup` attribute is supported on a subset of
[interactive elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html):

- `button`
- `input` in the `button` state
- `input` in the `email`, `number`, `search`, `tel`, `text`, or `url` states

#### Showing/hiding a `popup` element via the `popup` attribute

When an element with the `popup` attribute specified receives a user interaction that shows the
related `popup` element, this element shall be known as the `popup` element's _invoker_.

<p class="note">
  Multiple elements may have a popup attribute that refers to the same popup element. A given popup
  element only has 0 or 1 invokers at a given time. For example, if the popup element was shown
  programmatically, the invoker is null. Otherwise, the element that the user actually interacted
  with to show the popup is its sole invoker.
</p>

If the _invoker_ is a `button` element or an `input` element in the `button` state, and the
_invoker_ is activated; OR the _invoker_ is an input in the `email`, `number`, `search`, `tel`,
`text`, or `url` states and focus is set to the _invoker_, the user agent must run the following
steps:

1. Let _subject_ be the first element in tree order with the ID referenced by the `popup` attribute
   specified on the _invoker_. If there is no such element, or the _subject_ is not a `popup`
   element, then return.
2. Get the _subject_'s _open state_.
3. If _subject_'s _open state_ is `true`, run
   [hiding a `popup` element steps](#hiding-current-popups), with _subject_ and _invoker_.
4. Otherwise, run [showing a `popup` element steps](#showing-popup-steps) with _subject_ and _invoker_.

<h3 id="showing-popup-steps">
  Showing a <code>popup</code> element steps
</h3>

The **showing a `popup` element steps**, given a popup element _candidate subject_ and an optional
element _invoker_, and an optional element _anchor element_, are:

1. Run the [hiding currently-shown `popup` elements steps](#hiding-current-popups), with the
   _candidate subject_, _invoker_ if it was given, and _anchor element_ if it was given.
2. Add the _candidate subject_ to _candidate subject_'s
   [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s [popup stack](#popup-stack).
3. Set the _candidate subject_'s _open state_ to `true`.
4. If the `popup` element was shown as a result of a user interaction with an `invoker`,
   set the _candidate subject_'s _invoker_ to _invoker_.
5. Let _focusableArea_ be the result of [getting the focusable area
   steps](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#get-the-focusable-area) given _candidate subject_.
6. Run the [focusing steps](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focusing-steps) given _focusableArea_.

<p class="note">
  Without the presence of the autofocus or delegatefocus attribute, focus remains on the active
  element. This behavior is to enable scenarios where the popup is used in a composite control. For
  example, a combobox where the user expects their focus to stay in the text input instead of moving
  automatically to the listbox popup as and when it appears.
</p>

## Setting initial focus with the `autofocus` attribute

The [autofocus](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-autofocus-attribute)
content attribute allows the author to indicate that an element is to be focused as soon as the
page is loaded or as soon as the `popup` within which it finds itself is shown.

When specified on the `popup` element, it indicates that when the `popup` element is shown, focus
moves to the `popup` element.

**Example:**

```html
<popup autofocus>
  <p>The popup itself will receive focus.</p>
  <button>A focusable element</p>
</popup>
```

When specified on a descendent of the `popup` element, it indicates that when the `popup` element is
shown, focus will move to the descendent of the `popup` element where `autofocus` is specified.

**Example:**

```html
<popup>
  <p>Text goes here</p>
  <button>Button one</button>
  <button autofocus>Button two</p>
</popup>
```

## Setting initial focus with the `delegatesfocus` attribute

The `delegatesfocus` content attribute is a
[boolean attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attribute).
When specified, it indicates that when the `popup` element is shown, focus will move to the first
focusable descendent of the `popup` element.

**Example:**

```html
<popup delegatesfocus>
  <p>I am not a focusable element.</p>
  <p>Nor am I.</p>
  <button>I will be focused whenever the popup becomes focused.</button>
</popup>
```

<p class="note">
  As currently written in the
  <a href="#html-incubation-text-user-interaction-focus-processing-model">
    text to be inserted into the "get the focusable area steps"
  </a>: if both the delegatesfocus and autofocus content attributes are set on the popup element, the
  delegatesfocus behavior will take precedence (will be used).
</p>

## Anchoring a `popup` to another element

Many popups have a visual-logical relationship with another element that may not be a part of the
`popup` element's ancestry chain. For example, a `button` may control a `popup` element, and the
`popup` needs to be positioned with respect to this `button`. Or the `popup` element may simply be
used to draw attention to or describe another element. The `anchor` attribute indicates this
relationship. When specified, the attribute's value must be the ID of an element in the same
[node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document) as the `popup` element.

**Example:**

```html
<button id="myButton">Anchor element</button>
<popup open anchor="myButton">
  <p>
    <strong>New!</strong>
    I’m some sort of educational UI…
  </p>
</popup>
```

The target of the `anchor` attribute participates in determining whether a candidate `popup` element
is "nested" in a currently-shown `popup`; refer to <a href="#hiding-current-popups">hiding
currently-shown <code>popup</code> elements steps</a>.

<p class="todo">
  Whenever there is a spec to point to for CSS anchored positioning, call out here that the anchor
  attribute is used to help resolve CSS <code>anchor()</code> functions.
</p>

## Hiding a `popup` element

### The `hide()` method

The `hide()` method hides a `popup` element. The `hide()` method steps are to run the
[hiding a `popup` element steps](#hiding-popup-steps) with
[this](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#this).

### Light dismissal

"Light dismiss" describes the behavior of a component which dismisses itself automatically when a
user performs an action that implies that they are finished interacting with the component. The
actions that trigger light dismiss are:

- The user presses the escape key.
- A focus change occurs (because of either user interaction or script), where the focus target is
  outside of the contents of the component. This includes the case where the user invokes a
  non-focusable element, which causes focus to jump to the nearest focusable ancestor of that element.
- An OS-level focus change occurs such that the window containing the component no longer has focus.
  For example, the user switches to a different browser tab or switches to a different application.

When a `popup` element is shown and a light dismiss interaction occurs:

1. If a keypress event for the `ESCAPE` key was fired, run [hiding a `popup` element
   steps](#hiding-popup-steps), with the _candidate subject_ set to the top-most `popup` element in
   the [popup stack](#pop-stack).
2. If a focus change occurs, the user agent must set the _start node_ to the element which received
   the focus event and run [Hiding currently-shown `popup` elements steps](#hiding-current-popups).
3. Otherwise, the user agent must set the _start node_ to null and run [Hiding currently-shown
   `popup` elements steps](#hiding-current-popups).

<h3 id="hiding-current-popups">
  Hiding currently-shown <code>popup</code> elements steps
</h3>

The **hiding currently-shown `popup` elements steps**, given an optional popup element
_candidate subject_, an optional element _invoker_, and an optional element _anchor element_, and an
optional element _start node_, are as follows.

For each popup element _subject_ in the
[node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s [popup stack](#popup-stack):

1. If _candidate subject_ is null, run the
   [hiding a `popup` element steps](#hiding-popup-steps), with _subject_ as _candidate subject_.
2. Otherwise, starting with the _candidate subject_, walk the
   [flat tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/#flattening) to determine whether the _subject_
   is an ancestor to the _candidate subject_. If this condition is met, then return.
3. Otherwise, if the _invoker_ is not null, starting with the _invoker_, walk the
   [flat tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/#flattening) to determine whether the _subject_
   is an ancestor to the _invoker_. If this condition is met, then return.
4. Otherwise, if the _anchor element_ is not null, starting with the _anchor element_, walk the
   [flat tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/#flattening) to determine whether the _subject_
   is an ancestor to the _anchor element_. If this condition is met, then return.
5. If _start node_ is not null:
6. If the _start node_ is the _subject_, then return.
7. Otherwise, starting with the _start node_, walk the
   [flat tree](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/#flattening) to determine whether the _subject_
   is an ancestor to the _start node_. If this condition is met, then return.
8. Otherwise, for this _subject_, run the
   [hiding a `popup` element steps](#hiding-popup-steps), with _subject_ as _candidate subject_, and
   optional element _invoker_.

<h3 id="hiding-popup-steps">
  Hiding a <code>popup</code> element steps
</h3>

The **hiding a `popup` element steps**, given a `popup` element _candidate subject_ and an optional
element _invoker_, are as follows:

1. Remove the _candidate subject_ from the
   [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s [popup stack](#popup-stack).
2. Set the _candidate subject_'s _open state_ to `false`.
3. Set the _candidate subject_'s _invoker_ to _null_.
4. [Queue an element task](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#queue-an-element-task)
   on the [user interaction task source](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#user-interaction-task-source)
   given the _candidate subject_ element to
   [fire an event](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-event-fire)
   named `hide` at _candidate subject_.
